Maintain .ssh/config files with network dependent settings

How to use:

 ssh root@somehost
 somehost:~# cdnewdir .ssh-admin
 somehost:~/.ssh-admin# git clone https://github.com/pflanze/ssh-admin-share.git
 somehost:~/.ssh-admin# git init
 somehost:~/.ssh-admin# echo ssh-admin-share > .gitignore
 somehost:~/.ssh-admin# echo '#include "ssh-admin-share/config-common"' >> config-in

edit config-in to add more directives, like for example:

 # some comment
 # ('#' is a comment indicator unless followed by CPP directives)

 host t4
	 hostkeyalias someotherhost
 #if (network_t3||network_t3wlan||network_t4wlan)
	 hostname 192.168.1.2
 #else
	 # per t3-tunnel
	 port 3241
	 hostname 127.0.0.1
 #endif
 #if network_t3
	 Compression no
 #else
	 Compression yes
 #endif

Then run this every time the network changes (i.e. from some network
configuration hook):

 # cd ~/.ssh-admin/ssh-admin-share/ && make

Then symlink the generated config file to whichever accounts you want
to use it in:

 cd .ssh &&  lns ~root/.ssh-admin/.config

Note: if your ~root is not readable by others (as e.g. on Ubuntu) then
you might want to place .ssh-admin somewhere else.

Note2 2: the included Makefile assumes 'whami' to be around and in
PATH, which should print the name of the current network
configuration. You could instead call 'generate' with an argument of
your choice directly.
