Maintain .ssh/config files with network dependent settings

How to use:

 ssh root@somehost
 somehost:~# cdnewdir .ssh-config-gen
 somehost:~/.ssh-config-gen# git clone https://github.com/pflanze/ssh-config-gen-share.git
 somehost:~/.ssh-config-gen# git init
 somehost:~/.ssh-config-gen# echo ssh-config-gen-share > .gitignore
 somehost:~/.ssh-config-gen# echo '%include "ssh-config-gen-share/config-common"' >> config-in

Edit config-in to add more directives; all of the C preprocessor
directives are supported, but with '#' replaced by '%', and '#'
instead used as comment indicator. A CPP directive named after
'network_' and the name of the selected network appended is set to 1
when the preprocessor is run.  Example:

 # some comment

 host t4
	 hostkeyalias someotherhost
 %if (network_t3||network_t3wlan||network_t4wlan)
	 hostname 192.168.1.2
 %else
	 # per t3-tunnel
	 port 3241
	 hostname 127.0.0.1
 %endif
 %if network_t3
	 Compression no
 %else
	 Compression yes
 %endif

Then run this every time the network changes (i.e. from some network
configuration hook):

 # cd ~/.ssh-config-gen/ssh-config-gen-share/ && make

Then symlink the generated config file to whichever accounts you want
to use it in:

 cd .ssh &&  lns ~root/.ssh-config-gen/.config

Note: if your ~root is not readable by others (as e.g. on Ubuntu) then
you might want to place .ssh-config-gen somewhere else.

Note 2: the included Makefile assumes 'whami' to be around and in
PATH, which should print the name of the current network
configuration. You could instead call 'generate' with an argument of
your choice directly.
